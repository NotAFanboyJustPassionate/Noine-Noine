                <p>
                    The accomodation facilities at a Starboard Institute provide an exciting education experience. Nearly 80% of our student opt to 
                    live in the on-campus accomodation provided by us- making for a vibrant student experience. Every House hosts its own set of recreational,
                    academic and cultural activites in keeping with their traditions. Houses also host informal events which are great opportunities for
                    students to meet and exchange ideas or learn new skills. The biggest draw for on-campus accomodation is the the community that
                    you are signing up for. On-campus accomodation is an opportunity for students to engage with other like-minded people and gain be
                    part of an exciting community at the same time.
