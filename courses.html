                      <strong>Hyperloop Technology</strong> is a very rapidly growing industry in the Colostrum Sector. After proving to be very useful in the transportation of humans from all over Planet Earth to the Escape Spaceship - The Milano, during the Great Apocalypse, scientists have put in great efforts in the development of Hyperlooping.
                      Our Terra Nova Campus in the Colostrum Sector has been ranked number 1, in research and teaching of Hyperloop Technology. The Department of Hyperlooping is headed by none other than <strong>Dr. Phineas</strong> - Former Lead Scientist at Hyperlooper.Ltd, who is the most experienced professional in Hyperlooping. Faculty from the Hyperlooping Department have won 10 Aureus awards for their contributions in this field. Rest assured, if Hyperlooping interests you, this is the place you would definitely want to be in.</p>

                      Ever watched The Transformers movies from Planet Earth? If yes, we are sure you would be a huge fan of the recent developments in the new field of tech, <strong>Transformers Technology</strong> which involves hybrid vehicles that can also take a form of a Mega Robot. Although these Tranformers do not cause any destruction and are designed to help humans in various industries, they are just as interesting to learn about.
                      The Tranformers Technology department headed by <strong>Dr.Optimus</strong>, tech lead and researcher at Transformer.Ltd, is the first and only department in the whole of sector 8 that teaches everything there is to know about The Transformers. This course is only available at our Fortuna Ultor campus in sector 8 but we will soon be extending it to our Terra Nova campus as well.

                      The biggest challenge while moving out from Planet Earth during the Great Apocalypse was the availability of food. Although our current planet, <i>Solaris</i> had adequate water to sustain human life, it did not have the nutrients/minerals in its soil to sustain the life of crops that were brought from Planet Earth. This led to a new field in research called Space Agriculture and it has been the top-most industry in Planet Solaris since we first landed here. Developments in Space Agriculture has helped sustain human life on the planet. Our Institution boasts the best deaprtment of Space Agriculture in the entire planet, with the department at Terra Nova headed by <strong>Dr. Sprout</strong> and the one at Fortuna Ultor headed by <strong>Dr. Neville</strong>, two of the most respected scientists in the field. If you are interested in the sustenance of human life on Planet solaris through Space Agriculture, this is the course that you should definitely not miss.
